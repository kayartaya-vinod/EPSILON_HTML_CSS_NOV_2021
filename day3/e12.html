            The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native
            to Africa and India. It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short,
            rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail.
            It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females
            and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups
            called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related
            females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together,
            preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone
            predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and
            have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not.

        <p id="para2">
            Typically, the lion inhabits grasslands and savannas, but is absent
            in dense forests. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats,
            but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at
            twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout
            Africa, Southeast Europe, the Caucasus, and Western and South Asia,
            but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan
            Africa and one population in western India. It has been listed as
            Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in
            African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s.
            Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas.
            Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat
            loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.

            One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture,
            the lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings,
            on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions
            have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and
            have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoological gardens
            across the world since the late 18th century. Cultural depictions of
            lions were prominent in Ancient Egypt, and depictions have occurred
            in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures in the lion's
            historic and current range.
