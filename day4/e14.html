            <p id="p1" class="text-upper">
                The lion (<span class="decorate">Panthera leo</span>) is a large
                cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a
                muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears,
                and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually
                dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a
                prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called
                prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related
                females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together,
                preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and
                keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when
                opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the
                species typically does not.

                Typically, the lion inhabits grasslands and savannas, but is
                absent in dense forests.
                <span class="text-upper"
                    >It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when
                    persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at
                    twilight</span
                >. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout
                Africa, Southeast Europe, the Caucasus, and Western and South
                Asia, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in
                sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It has
                been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996
                because populations in African countries have declined by about
                43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable
                outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the
                decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with
                humans are the greatest causes for concern.

                One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human
                culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures
                and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and
                literature.
                <span class="text-upper"
                    >Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the
                    Roman Empire and have been a key species sought for
                    exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the
                    late 18th century</span
                >. Cultural depictions of lions were prominent in Ancient Egypt,
                and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and
                medieval cultures in the lion's historic and current range.
